# VSCode - Maya Setup

## Connect VSCode to Maya

### Step 1

### Step 2

### Step 3

### Set your interpreter to `mayapy`:

* In VSCode, open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS)
* Select `Python: Select Interpreter`
* Choose your Maya Python path
  * On Windows: `C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Maya2025\bin\mayapy.exe`
  * On Mac: `/applications/Autodesk/maya2025/Maya.app/Contents/bin/mayapy`
  * On Linux: `/usr/autodesk/maya2025/bin/mayapy`
* You may be asked to select an environment, which is VSCode confirming your choice. Choose the top option, or whichever one clearly shows `mayapy`. If unsure, hover to confirm the full path matches one of the above. After selecting, you should see `mayapy` in the bottom-left status bar of VSCode, confirming that it is active and ready.

## (Optional) Autocompletion

Even after setting your interpreter to Maya's internal Python interpreter (`mayapy`), you might notice that autocomplete is minimal. This is because VSCode uses static analysis to generate autocomplete suggestions, but Maya's `maya.cmds` module is compiled and doesn't expose detailed function definitions by default. So even with the correct interpreter set, VSCode doesn't "see" enough information to offer help.

The solution? **Stubs!** If you're unfamiliar with stubs, they're lightweight files that include things like docstrings and type hints. They help VSCode understand what your code is doing so it can offer autocomplete and helpful suggestions.

### How to install the `maya-stubs` package by Muream:

In your system terminal or the integrated terminal inside VSCode, run the following command, replacing `/path/to/maya` with the actual path to your Maya's Python interpreter:  

    /path/to/mayapy -m pip install maya-stubs

_Note: This command will not work in the Maya Script Editor nor Python console._

Since you have already set `mayapy` as your interpreter per the setup instructions above, VSCode should automatically detect the change. If needed, restart VSCode or refresh the window by going to the Command Palette and selecting `Developer: Reload Window`.

Alternatively, if you'd like to inspect or tweak autocomplete behavior, you may manually download the stubs:

## Troubleshooting FAQ

### "I was able to send my Python code to Maya and create a basic sphere per the instructions, but I'm seeing the message: _Import "maya.cmds" could not be resolved._

This warning is coming from your Python language server (usually Pylance in VSCode). It means your editor can't find the `maya` module in your current Python environment. This is expected because `maya.cmds` is only available through Maya's built-in Python interpreter, called `mayapy`, and not in your regular Python environment. Your code will still run fine when sent to Maya, so you can safely ignore the warning unless you want full autocomplete support (see next question).

### "Why is autocomplete for maya.cmds nonfunctional?"

### I installed Maya, but Bifrost and Arnold Renderer weren't installed successfully.  

Your Python for Maya course will not require Bifrost nor Arnold. As long as your core Maya installation is working, you are good to go! If you'd like to explore these plug-ins outside of the Python for Maya course, you may find these links helpful:

### I'm seeing a port error in Maya: _Error: Unrecognized action "port localhost:7001."_
