# VSCode - Maya Setup

## Connect VSCode to Maya

### Step 1

### Step 2

### Step 3

## (Optional) Autocompletion

## Troubleshooting FAQ

### 1) "I was able to send my Python code to Maya and create a basic sphere per the instructions, but I'm seeing the message: _'Import "maya.cmds" could not be resolved.'_

### 2) "Why is autocomplete for maya.cmds nonfunctional?"

### 3) I installed Maya, but Bifrost and Arnold Renderer weren't installed successfully.  

Your Python for Maya course will not require Bifrost nor Arnold. As long as your core Maya installation is working, you are good to go! If you'd like to explore these plug-ins outside of the Python for Maya course, try [Bifrost Help](https://help.autodesk.com/view/BIFROST/ENU/?guid=Bifrost_MayaPlugin_install_bifrost_for_maya_html) and [Arnold for Maya Installation](https://help.autodesk.com/view/ARNOL/ENU/?guid=arnold_for_maya_getting_started_am_Installation_html).

### 4) I'm seeing a port error in Maya: _'Error: Unrecognized action "port localhost:7001.'_
